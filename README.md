# PortfolioWebsite

Trying to develop a personal website, which I can use to showcase my projects.
Currently uses Flask/Python 3. May not be a strict requirement, but its the only way I know right now.
Suggestions are welcome, please add them in the form of issues.
Or, contribute code if you would be so kind!
